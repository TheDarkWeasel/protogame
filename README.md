# BloodBuilder
BloodBuilder is a simple RTS, with the following rules:
  - Units are built for no costs at all
  - For constructing a building you need blood
  - Blood is provided by sacrificing units
 
These rules force the player to consider whether it is worth building a new building and sacrificing valuable units.

# What is working

  - Constructing a player base
  - Basic camera movement
  - Buildings and Units are selectable
  - Units are put in a build queue by pressing 'I' and are then produced after a specific time
  - Barracks can now be built by sacrificing 3 units
  - UI! Build buildings and units via the actions menu on the bottom right of the screen!

# What is not working
  - Everything else
