# Necrosynthesia (Prototype)
__Further development of Necrosynthesia will take place in a private repository. I will still leave this repository as it is
so people may learn from it :) Also I may still occasionally update the unity version. If you are interested in how the game
develops, you can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/necrosynthesia) and [itch.io](https://d4rkweasel.itch.io/necrosynthesia).__

Necrosynthesia is a simple RTS, with the following rules:
  - Units are built for no costs at all
  - For constructing a building you need blood
  - Blood is provided by sacrificing units
 
These rules force the player to consider whether it is worth building a new building and sacrificing valuable units.

# What is working

  - Constructing a player base
  - Basic camera movement
  - Buildings and Units are selectable
  - Units are put in a build queue by pressing 'I' and are then produced after a specific time
  - Barracks can now be built by sacrificing 3 units
  - UI! Build buildings and units via the actions menu on the bottom right of the screen!
  - Unit movement

# What is missing
  - Support for multiple (CPU-)players
  - Attack system
  - Player starting points
  - AI
  - Winning conditions
  - Fog of war
  - At least one nice map
  - More units/buildings
  - Polish
  - Balancing
  - Everything else, I forgot to list here ;)
